# arctic_greening
This repository includes scripts that were used to assses changes in tundra greenness and it's relationships with summer air temperatures during recent decades across the Arctic tundra biome. Tundra greenness was assessed using annual maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVImax) from 1985 to 2016 derived using surface reflectance measurements by sensors on the Landsat satellites. Summer air temperatures were quantified using five global temperature data sets. Most of the scripts in this repository are written in R. These scripts are associated with the following peer-reviewed publication:
